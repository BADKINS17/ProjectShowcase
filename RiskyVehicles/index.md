# Project: Identifying Risky Vehicles from Crash Data

**Overview:**  
Used clustering and classification techniques on crash data to identify vehicle makes and models associated with higher accident rates.

**Tools:** Python, scikit-learn, Tableau

**Files:**

- [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/BADKINS17/ProjectShowcase/blob/main/RiskyVehicles/RiskyVehicles.ipynb): EDA, clustering models, and risk profiling.
- [PowerPoint Presentation](https://github.com/BADKINS17/ProjectShowcase/blob/main/RiskyVehicles/RiskyVehicles.pptx): Summary presentation with charts.
- [Tableau Workbook](https://github.com/BADKINS17/ProjectShowcase/blob/main/RiskyVehicles/RiskyVehicles.twbx): Tableau dashboard for vehicle risk metrics.
- [Report](https://github.com/BADKINS17/ProjectShowcase/blob/main/RiskyVehicles/RiskyVehicles.docx): Final written report and analysis.

**Summary:**  
The goal of this project was to help insurers and regulators better understand vehicle-related risk using historical crash data and clustering techniques.
