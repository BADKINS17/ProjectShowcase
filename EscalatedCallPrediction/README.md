# Project: Escalated Call Prediction with Machine Learning

**Overview:**  
Built a predictive model to identify which customer service calls are likely to escalate, enabling proactive customer service.

**Tools:** Python, scikit-learn, pandas, PowerPoint

**Files:**

- [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/BADKINS17/ProjectShowcase/blob/main/EscalatedCallPrediction/EscalatedCallPrediction.ipynb): Data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- [PowerPoint Presentation](https://github.com/BADKINS17/ProjectShowcase/blob/main/EscalatedCallPrediction/EscalatedCallPrediction.pptx): Summary of findings and model performance.
- [Report](https://github.com/BADKINS17/ProjectShowcase/blob/main/EscalatedCallPrediction/EscalatedCallPrediction.docx): Formal report detailing approach and results.

**Summary:**  
This project demonstrates how classification models can be applied to customer support data to flag potentially high-risk cases and reduce churn.
