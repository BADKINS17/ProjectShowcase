# Project: Kia_HyundaiThefts

**Overview:**  
This project examines theft trends and vulnerabilities associated with certain vehicles from Kia and Hyundai, using data analysis and visualization to map hotspots, temporal patterns, and prevention insights.

**Tools:**  
Python, Jupyter Notebook, Tableau, PowerPoint, GitHub

**Files:**  
- [Kia_HyundaiThefts.Rmd](./Kia_HyundaiThefts.Rmd): R Studio performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) of theft incidents.  
- [report.docx](./report.docx): Written report summarizing methodologies, data sources, findings, and recommendations.  
- [Kia_HyundaiThefts.pptx](https://github.com/BADKINS17/ProjectShowcase/blob/main/Kia_HyundaiThefts/Kia_HyundaiThefts.pptx): PowerPoint presentation visualizing key results and insights.

**Summary:**  
Using detailed incident data for Kia and Hyundai vehicles, this project uncovers patterns in how, where, and when vehicle thefts occur. The Jupyter notebook walks through data cleaning, aggregation, and initial findings; the written report interprets results and proposes actionable recommendations; the PowerPoint presents the major insights in slide form; and the Tableau workbook allows users to explore theft trends by geography, model year, and time. Together, these resources support stakeholders in identifying high-risk zones and enhancing preventive measures.
