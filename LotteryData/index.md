# Project: Lottery Data Analysis

**Overview:**  
Historical lottery draw analysis to understand number distributions, trends, and possible predictability.

**Tools:**  
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn), Jupyter Notebooks, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau, PowerPoint

**Files:**  
- [PowerPoint Presentation](https://github.com/BADKINS17/ProjectShowcase/tree/main/LotteryData/LotteryData.pptx): Slide deck summarizing project goals, methodology, key insights, and visual findings from the lottery data analysis.  
- [Tableau Dashboard](https://github.com/BADKINS17/ProjectShowcase/tree/main/LotteryData/LotteryData.twb): Interactive Tableau workbook featuring number frequency charts, trend visualizations, and exploratory dashboards for deeper analysis of draw patterns.  

**Summary:**  
This project collects historical lottery draw data to explore the statistical properties of lottery numbers. Through data cleaning, frequency analysis, and visualization in Tableau, the project investigates whether past draw patterns exhibit meaningful structure. Simple probabilistic models are built to test the feasibility of prediction. The goal is not to beat the lottery but to apply data science tools to a high-noise, high-randomness domain—gaining insight into randomness, number recurrence, and the limits of predictability.
