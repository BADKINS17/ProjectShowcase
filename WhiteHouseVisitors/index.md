**Summary:**  
By analysing visitor records to the White House, this project uncovers when visitor peaks occur, which demographics or regions send the most visitors, and how visitor patterns shift over time. The notebook walks through data cleaning, modelling, and initial findings; the report interprets the results and proposes strategies to optimise visitor experience; the PowerPoint presents the story visually; and the Tableau workbook allows stakeholders to explore visitor behaviour interactively.
