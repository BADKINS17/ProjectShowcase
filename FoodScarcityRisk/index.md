**Summary:**  
Food scarcity is influenced by complex factors such as climate variability, supply chain constraints, population growth, and economic conditions. This project develops a predictive framework to quantify risk levels using publicly available datasets, including access to nutrional food and past SNAP participation indicators. The outcome is a Food Scarcity Risk Score that can help governmental agencies, communities, and researchers prioritize areas needing intervention.
