**Summary:**  
Food scarcity is influenced by complex factors such as climate variability, supply chain constraints, population growth, and economic conditions. This project develops a predictive framework to quantify risk levels using publicly available datasets, including climate records, agricultural production data, and demographic indicators. The outcome is a Food Scarcity Risk Score that can help NGOs, governments, and researchers prioritize areas needing intervention. Deliverables include machine-learning models, visual dashboards, and a complete written analysis.
