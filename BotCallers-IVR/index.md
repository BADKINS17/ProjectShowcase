# Project: BotCallers-IVR

**Overview:**  
Developed an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system that automates inbound and outbound phone call interactions, allowing users to navigate voice menus and collect information using DTMF inputs.

**Tools:**  
Python, Jupyter Notebook, Tableau, PowerPoint, Docker, Twilio API

**Files:**  
- [Jupyter Notebook](./BotCallers-IVR/BotCallers-IVR.ipynb): Jupyter notebook with exploratory data analysis (EDA) and system performance insights.  
- [Report](./report.docx): Written report describing methodology, architecture, and evaluation.  
- [PowerPoint Presentation](https://github.com/BADKINS17/ProjectShowcase/blob/main/BotCallers-IVR/BotCallers-IVR.pptx): Visual walkthrough and key findings.  
- [Tableau Workbook](https://github.com/BADKINS17/ProjectShowcase/blob/main/BotCallers-IVR/BotCallers-IVR.twbx): Interactive Tableau dashboard visualizing call analytics and IVR flows.

**Summary:**  
This project showcases the design and implementation of a scalable IVR system that automates voice interactions using programmable APIs. It analyzes call patterns, flow efficiency, and customer engagement through data visualizations and performance metrics. The notebook provides exploratory analysis of call data, while the Tableau dashboard offers interactive insights into user behavior and call routing effectiveness.
