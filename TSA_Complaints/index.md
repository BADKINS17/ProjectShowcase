# Project: TSA Complaints

**Overview:**  
This project analyzes customer complaint data from the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to identify patterns, common issues, and trends in service performance and passenger experience.

**Tools:**  
Python, Jupyter Notebook, Tableau, PowerPoint, GitHub

**Files:**  
- [TSA_Complaints.ipynb](./TSA_Complaints.ipynb): Jupyter notebook containing exploratory data analysis (EDA) of TSA complaint records.  
- [report.docx](./report.docx): Written report summarizing data sources, methodology, key findings and recommendations.  
- [TSA_Complaints.pptx](https://github.com/BADKINS17/ProjectShowcase/blob/main/TSA_Complaints/TSA_Complaints.pptx): PowerPoint presentation visualizing major insights and trends.  
- [TSA_Complaints.twbx](https://github.com/BADKINS17/ProjectShowcase/blob/main/TSA_Complaints/TSA_Complaints.twbx): Tableau workbook for interactive exploration of complaint types, locations, and timelines.

**Summary:**  
By investigating TSA complaint data, this project uncovers where and when passenger-service issues are most prevalent, which complaint categories dominate, and how they change over time. The notebook drives the analysis from raw incident logs to aggregated insights; the report interprets these findings and proposes actionable improvements; the presentation distills the story visually; and the Tableau workbook allows stakeholders to explore complaint patterns by airport, date, and complaint type.
